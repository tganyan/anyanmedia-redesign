# Suggested updates

Hey - 

I made a series of suggested updates to your project that I would ask you to consider. These are structural updates and suggestions for code management. 

Also, I am assuming that you are running a local `sass --watch` command, so with this new structure you could use the following command to run the watch. 

	$ sass --watch app/assets/sass/applicion.scss:public/stylesheets/application.css
	
Look for more readme.md docs and inline code comments.
